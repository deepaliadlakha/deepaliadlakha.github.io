== Spring 2015

=== Image De-noising and De-Mosaicing using KSVD
Guide: Prof. Ajit Rajwade\n[https://github.com/deepaliadlakha/projects/blob/master/Denoising.pdf \[report\]] [https://github.com/Tanmay-r/Computer-Vision/tree/master/Project \[code\]]
- Learnt a dictionary using KSVD; implemented sparse coding using Orthogonal Matching Pursuit on a set of natural images
- Used different dictionary sizes, patch sizes etc. and compared results for de-noising

=== Smart Lab
Guide: Prof. Krithi Ramamritham\n[https://github.com/deepaliadlakha/projects/blob/master/es-report.pdf \[report\]]
- Built a room automation system that predicts and controls the lights and fans in a room where a large number of such appliances are deployed and each user has her own preferences
- The prediction algorithm employed is influenced by factors such as the time of the day, user and history of appliance usage

== Fall 2014

=== Cost Metric in Query Optimization
Guide: Prof. S. Sudarshan\n[https://github.com/deepaliadlakha/projects/blob/master/db-report.pdf \[report\]]
- Worked on improving the efficiency of the cost metric in the PyroJ query optimizer in order to achieve efficient query plans for execution
- Enhanced query processing based on information about number of table and index accesses, block read/writes collected using the Statistics Collector toolbox of PostgreSQL

=== Texture Classification using Textons
Guide: Prof. Suyash Awate, Prof. Ajit Rajwade\n[https://github.com/deepaliadlakha/projects/blob/master/TextureClassification.pdf \[report\]] [https://github.com/Tanmay-r/Digital-Image-Processing/tree/master/Project \[code\]]
- Implemented framework for characterising a texture by its responses to a set of orientation and spatial-frequency selective linear filters; clustered these responses into a bunch of textons and modelled using SVM
- Explored the application of \textbf{texture classification} in image categorization and segmentation

== Spring 2014

=== Virtual Memory Management
Guide: Prof. Dhananjay Dhamdhere\n[https://github.com/deepaliadlakha/projects/blob/master/VirtualMemory.pdf \[report\]]
- Added virtual memory manager to Pranali, an experimental OS built on top of Linux

=== Control Flow Graph Language Processor
Guide: Prof. Uday Khedkar
- Developed a language processor for cfg dumps generated by gcc
- Implemented compiler features like lexical analysis, syntax checking, semantic analysis, code generation and evaluation

== Fall 2013

=== Integrated Network for Customers and Vendors
Guide: Prof. Umesh Bellur\n[https://github.com/deepaliadlakha/projects/blob/master/387-Project-Report.pdf \[report\]][https://github.com/astha/ConsumerConnect \[code\]]
- Developed an \textbf{online service platform} to collate services offered in market catalogued on the type of service and location using PHP and MySQL
- Incorporated features to book/cancel appointments pertaining to desired services, provide a recommendation system linked to trust, address common customers' queries and facilitate communication among participants
