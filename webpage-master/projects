= Vipul Venkataraman---Projects

The key projects I have worked on are listed below, semester wise. I have tried to keep the project descriptions brief. Feel free to [http://www.cse.iitb.ac.in/~vipulv/ contact] me for any details.

== Spring 2016

=== Link Prediction via Graph Embedding in Large Social Networks
Guide: Prof. Jiawei Han\n[http://web.engr.illinois.edu/~vvnktrm2/projects/advdm-report.pdf \[report\]], [http://web.engr.illinois.edu/~vvnktrm2/projects/advdm-slides.pdf \[slides\]]
- Integrated graph embedding techniques to facilitate the important problem of predicting links in large heterogeneous networks
- Tackled the network sparsity problem by introducing meaningful links obtained via graph embedding to capture latent information, and achieved a 47\% increase in accuracy from the state-of-the-art

== Fall 2015

=== Preventing Overfitting in Machine Learning Classifiers via Dropout Training
Guide: Prof. Dan Roth\n[http://web.engr.illinois.edu/~vvnktrm2/projects/ml-report.pdf \[report\]]
- Explored the properties of Dropout training by modifying the training algorithm and analyzing change in performance
- Extended the Dropout method---which was originally designed for training Neural Networks---for training Perceptrons and Support Vector Machines

=== Kaggle Competition: Human or Robot?
Guide: Prof. Kevin Chang\n[http://web.engr.illinois.edu/~vvnktrm2/projects/dm-report.pdf \[report\]]
- Used various classification algorithms such as Random Forests, Boosted Random Forests, Bagged SVMs and AdaBoost for the Human or Robot Kaggle Competition, where the goal was to predict if an online bidder is a human or a robot based on the history of bids on an online auction platform
- Secured second place in the overall leaderboard

== Spring 2015

=== Smart Lab
Guide: Prof. Krithi Ramamritham\n[http://web.engr.illinois.edu/~vvnktrm2/projects/es-report.pdf \[report\]]
- Built a room automation system that predicts and controls the lights and fans in a room where a large number of such appliances are deployed and each user has her own preferences
- The prediction algorithm employed is influenced by factors such as the time of the day, user and history of appliance usage

== Fall 2014

=== Cost Metric in Query Optimization
Guide: Prof. S. Sudarshan\n[http://web.engr.illinois.edu/~vvnktrm2/projects/db-report.pdf \[report\]]
- Worked on improving the efficiency of the cost metric in the PyroJ query optimizer in order to achieve efficient query plans for execution
- Enhanced query processing based on information about number of table and index accesses, block read/writes collected using the Statistics Collector toolbox of PostgreSQL

=== Texture Synthesis by Non-parametric Sampling
Guide: Prof. Suyash Awate, Prof. Ajit Rajwade\n[http://web.engr.illinois.edu/~vvnktrm2/projects/dip-report.pdf \[report\]]
- Applied a statistical non-parametric model for algorithmically constructing a large digital image from a small image by taking advantage of spatial locality for constrained texture synthesis problems
- Modelled texture as a Markov Random Field where the texture synthesis process grows a new image outward from an initial seed, one pixel at a time

== Spring 2014

=== Virtual Memory Management
Guide: Prof. Dhananjay Dhamdhere\n[http://web.engr.illinois.edu/~vvnktrm2/projects/os-report.pdf \[report\]]
- Added virtual memory management to Pranali OS, an experimental OS built on top of Linux
- Implemented effective data structures and algorithms for handling process memory allocation, swap space management, multilevel page table for address translation and several page replacement strategies

=== Control Flow Graph Language Processor 
Guide: Prof. Uday Khedkar
- Developed a language processor for cfg dumps generated by gcc
- Implemented compiler features like lexical analysis, syntax checking, semantic analysis, code generation and evaluation

== Fall 2013

=== Inventory Management System
Guide: Prof. Umesh Bellur\n[http://web.engr.illinois.edu/~vvnktrm2/projects/dbms-report.pdf \[report\]]
- Developed an integrated system using PostgreSQL to place orders with vendors, exchange inventories among different branches, maintain customer and employee records for large organizations having huge inventory stock
- Designed an algorithm which predicts the inventory that would be required in future depending upon the current stock and past transactions in any particular branch of the organization

=== Parallel Processing in Multi Core Architectures
Guide: Prof. Bernard Menezes\n[http://web.engr.illinois.edu/~vvnktrm2/projects/arch-report.pdf \[report\]]
- Analyzed performance gains in multi core architecture owing to their exploitation of thread level parallelism on Parallel Sum, Merge Sort, Matrix Multiplication, Monte Carlo Simulation and the Bellman Ford algorithm
- Estimated the degree of parallelism of a program through analysis techniques using the Karp Flatt metric

== Spring 2013

=== Fast Fourier Transform 
Guide: Prof. Ashwin Gumaste\n[http://web.engr.illinois.edu/~vvnktrm2/projects/fft-slides.pdf \[slides\]]
- Developed combinatorial circuit in VHDL for 8-point, radix 2, decimation-in-frequency Fast Fourier Transform using the Cooley-Tukey algorithm
- Implemented on a Xilinx Spartan-6 LX45 FPGA, with interactive user inputs and outputs utilizing onboard switches and LEDs

== Fall 2012

=== Depth Estimation from a Single Still Monocular Image
Guide: Prof. Varsha Apte\n[http://web.engr.illinois.edu/~vvnktrm2/projects/293-slides.pdf \[slides\]]
- Applied Supervised Learning to predict the depth-map as a function of the image using monocular cues
- Chose features that capture three types of local cues: texture variations, texture gradients and haze to predict the relative depth between different patches in the image
