= Vipul Venkataraman---Highlights

This is where I humble-brag. Since I do not have enough to talk about in comparison to many I have worked with (see [http://web.engr.illinois.edu/~adityagp/index.html\#synergy here]), I shall include non-academic stuff as well: hence the name "Highlights"---as opposed to the stereotypical "News". If you are unrelenting and prefer the latter instead, see [http://www.thehindu.com/ here].
