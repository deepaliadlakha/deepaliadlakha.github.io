== Internships

=== BloomReach

Topic: Automated Entity Linking and Attribute Boosting at Scale\n\[slides-redacted\]

- Developed scalable methods for automated entity linking and attribute boosting using semi-structured and unstructured product data from e-commerce sites
- Boosted the size of the attribute dictionary by 3.8 times via ontology propagation

=== Microsoft Research Bangalore
Topic: Efficient Sampling for Probabilistic Programs\n
Guide: [http://www.research.microsoft.com/en-us/people/adityan/ Dr. Aditya Nori]\n
[http://web.engr.illinois.edu/~vvnktrm2/talks/msr.pdf \[slides\]]

- Modified the Hamiltonian Monte Carlo Sampling technique using program analysis
- Improved inference efficiency, in Microsoft's inference tool [http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/projects/r2/ R2]; bettered Church, Venture and Infer.net with shorter execution time in various benchmarks 

=== Technische Universitat Braunschweig
Topic: VC Dimension of Art Gallery Problems\n
Guide: [https://www.ibr.cs.tu-bs.de/users/fekete/ Prof. Sandor Fekete]\n
[http://vvnktrm2.web.engr.illinois.edu/research/tub.pdf \[feedback-letter\]]

- Analyzed arrangements of point sets within polygons and their straight line visibility
- Worked on the case of polygons without holes; proved the VC dimension of a symmetric gallery without holes as six, the current best lower bound 

=== The Institute of Mathematical Sciences

Topic: Block Sorting\nGuide: [http://www.imsc.res.in/~meena/ Prof. Meena Mahajan]

- Worked on the problem of block sorting, in the context of genome rearrangements
- Explored new possibilities of improving the current best upper bound of 2n/3 moves for block sorting; developed alternate methods to achieve the same bound

== Summer School

=== Microsoft Research Bangalore
Topic: Machine Learning Applications in Big Data

- Attended a summer school on topics such as logistic regression, support vector machines, decision trees, principal component analysis, probabilistic topic models
- Secured 2/50 in the Microsoft Azure ML Hackathon among summer school participants
