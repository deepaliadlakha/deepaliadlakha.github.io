== About me

Vipul Venkataraman is a living legend from ancient Madras. The mountains crumbled, the rivers flooded, the birds flew upside down and the snakes stopped hibernating when the he stepped on Earth. He has written his biography in third person not because it is a widely used norm, but because it looks cool.

He is currently in the second year of his Graduate Studies at UIUC. He [http://web.engr.illinois.edu/~vvnktrm2/pics/convo.jpg completed] his Bachelor's in Computer Science at IIT Bombay. He was born in the city of Pune. He spent the rest of his life at Madras (now known as Chennai), before moving to Mumbai for his undergrad. Vipul chose to leave his home town and study at IIT Bombay---and not at Madras---because of his overly active and impulsive behaviour which started to present serious management issues at home.

Vipul enjoys playing chess, and has even played against the mighty [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viswanathan_Anand Vishwanathan Anand] once. Much to everyone's surprise, he lost that match. He likes bragging about this to people and he is going to do that again by asking you to have a look at this [http://web.engr.illinois.edu/~vvnktrm2/pics/chess.jpg picture] of him playing with Anand. Cricket used to be his passion before he got studious and decided to focus on academics. He started playing the sport when he was 10. [http://web.engr.illinois.edu/~vvnktrm2/pics/cricket.jpg This] is how he looked back then. He resumed playing cricket again in college but could never reach the abilities of his old---and in some ways, young---self.

He is incredibly passionate about writing, which would have definitely come as a rude shock to anyone reading this. He is hated by all his friends, thanks to the absurdish humor he possesses. He likes writing about philosophy and humor. He maintains (edit: used to) a [http://vipulvenkataraman.wordpress.com/ blog], which is only visited by him and his loving mother. He is working on a new blog post as you are reading this.
