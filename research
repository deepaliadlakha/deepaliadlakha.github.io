=== Bachelor's Thesis
- Dictionary Learning Algorithms and Applications\nAdvisor: [http://www.cse.iitb.ac.in/~suyash/ Prof. Suyash Awate]\n[https://github.com/deepaliadlakha/btp/blob/master/Deepali_BTP_Report2.pdf \[thesis\]]

== Research

=== Machine Learning
- Dictionary Learning Algorithms and Applications\nBachelor Thesis, IIT Bombay\nGuide: [http://www.cse.iitb.ac.in/~suyash/ Prof. Suyash Awate]\n[https://github.com/deepaliadlakha/btp/blob/master/Deepali_BTP_Report2.pdf \[report\]][https://github.com/deepaliadlakha/DictionaryAlgorithm \[code\]]
	-- Explored and implemented algorithms for dictionary learning formulated as sparse-regression/L1-optimization problems in Euclidean or non Euclidean spaces
	-- Worked on applications of sparse coding using the learned dictionary for image analysis


=== Augmented Reality
- Object Orientation Detection in Augmented Reality Applications\nMicrosoft Research, Redmond\nMentor: [https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/people/eyalofek/ Eyal Ofek]
	-- Formulated real-time tracking of a hand held device in 3D space using Kinect; recovered the location and orientation of the device based on random sample consensus for parameter estimation
	-- Ensured robustness of the system through integration with optical flow and orientation sensor measurements

=== Systems
- Energy Efficiency in Wireless Sensor Nodes\nTechnical University, Braunschweig, Germany\nMentor: [https://www.ibr.cs.tu-bs.de/users/wolf/ Dr. Lars Wolf]\n[https://github.com/deepaliadlakha/tub-internship \[code\]]
	-- Designed and implemented a self learning and adaptive algorithm to under-volt the main micro-controller of wireless sensor node for improving energy efficiency
	-- Formulated an Inter Integrated Circuit (I2C) protocol based on closed loop control with a secure and reliable instance in order to achieve a balanced state between faultless execution and optimum power dissipation
